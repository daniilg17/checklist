# Checklist
### QA checklist for form testing (test task project).

ðŸ“š Project Description 
This project is a test assignment for manual testing of a user interface.  
As part of the task, a highly detailed checklist was created for the web page screen to test its visual components, validation, input fields, accessibility, security, and other aspects.

The project does not contain any code â€” it features the checklist itself as a demonstration of testing skills.

### ðŸ“‹ Task 

Link to the page that needs to be tested: 
https://widgets.inssmart.ru/contract/mortgage/?appId=79f46bfb-d4ba-50aa-8269-7289dd16700c&secret=6ca520c0-328b-5b65-ab5c-b41332a3e667

Create a list of checks (checklist), grouped in a hierarchical list format, for the page that would be sufficient for releasing the product to production.  
Specify priorities and expected results.
